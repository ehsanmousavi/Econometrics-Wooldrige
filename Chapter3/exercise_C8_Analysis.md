# Exercise C8 Analysis:

## (ii):
The coefficient of prpblck is approximately 0.1150. Since prpblck represents the proportion of the black population in the given zip code, it ranges between 0 and 1. Therefore, even a large change in prpblck leads to a small change in psoda. For example, a 50% increase in prpblck (i.e., an increase by 0.50) would lead to an increase of about 0.0575 in psoda (0.1150 * 0.50).
This indicates that although the proportion of the black population in a given zip code has a statistically significant effect on the price of soda, the effect is small.

## (iii):
I found out that since the coefficient of prpblck in a model without income is 0.06493, the impact of prpblck on the price of soda becomes even smaller in the new model. Consequently, it is likely that the proportion of the black population is not a key factor in the pricing of soda. However, it has a statistically significant effect on the price of soda. Therefore, perhaps the effect of the proportion of the black population in a given zip code affects the price of soda indirectly through other factors rather than being the key driver.
