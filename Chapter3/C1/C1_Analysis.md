# Exercise C1 Analysis:
By comparing the two equations, we can see that the inclusion of family income reduces the impact of cigarette smoking on birth weight. However, the reduction is not significant, and the reason is the low correlation between the two variables.
Moreover, family income had a very small impact on birth weight. For instance, increasing family income by $32,000, approximately the median family income in 1988 (U.S. Census Bureau 1989, 4), would increase birth weight by only approximately 0.084 ounces.
