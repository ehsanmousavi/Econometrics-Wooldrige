# Exercise C9 Analysis:

## (i):
The p-value is 0.0181. At the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is less than 0.05. However, at the 1% significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that b1 is not statistically different from zero at this level.

## (ii):
Since we have some NAs and the missing data is missing at random (MAR), we can ignore the NAs and calculate the correlation.
The correlation is about -0.84, indicating a high degree of multicollinearity.
